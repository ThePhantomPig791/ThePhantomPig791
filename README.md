Hello, I'm ThePhantomPig791, or Phantom. I code origins for the Origins mod for Minecraft using datapacks, and dabble with a bit of modding, too.

I'm currently working on a Super Mario Odyssey origin, which brings Cappy into Minecraft.

I'm also "working" (~~I say "working" because I haven't worked on it in months~~ I just updated it the other day :D) on a datapack that brings Attack On Titan into Minecraft, expanding upon an old pack from UserNull, with his permission. -- I'm now working on a complete rewrite of that pack, creating it from the ground up to allow more titan potential.

On top of this, I'm also making a Tunneler origin inspired by Portal, which lets you create non-euclidean portals at will, using the Origins and Immersive Portals mod for Fabric.



Also Davigo is a great game go try it out
