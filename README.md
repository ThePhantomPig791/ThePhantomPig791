Hello, I'm PhantomPig791, or Phantom. I code origins for the Origins mod for Minecraft using datapacks, and dabble with a bit of fabric modding, too.


I'm also working on a datapack that brings Attack On Titan into Minecraft, expanding upon an old pack from UserNull, with his permission. -- ___I'm now working on a complete rewrite of that pack, creating it from the ground up to allow more titan potential.___


Also Davigo is a great game go try it out
